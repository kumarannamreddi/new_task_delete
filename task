Kumar,

1)	Hide all the script outputs to a file that we can review later if need, from your “EC2 create” process.
2)	Add a logfile to your EC2 create for a new customer so we can see the output of the commands, checking for ORA error that we saw when the database failed to start
3)	Create a new script using the “EC2 create” process, to loop through the file with all the customer server names and IPs that we have created ( you might need to create a couple customer EC2s, so you have something to test against.  
a.	In the loop, for each existing customer, you will need to:
i.	 shutdown the database:
db XPPNP
spdba
shutdown immediate;
exit
ii.	Unmount the database ebs volume 
iii.	Mount the new snapshot  -- From your ebs snapshot process
iv.	Startup the database:
db XPPNP
spdba
statup 
Exit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)	After the above has been completed and tested, then you will need to work with Matt and utilize his code to create a new process called “Uncompress”  (Jira Task CTE-342)
a.	Logon to server 10.146.55.4 ( ask matt for assistance, you will need to use the ctestmt.pem to connect.
b.	Using database XPMRTA, you will need to run the follow uncompress scripts in code, calling from a file like Matt currently does for his backup/restore/encrypt processes.
